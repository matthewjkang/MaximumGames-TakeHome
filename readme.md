# Maximum Games, Data Analyst - Take Home Interview 

We have attached a .csv file to this email containing historical preorder data for a variety of games. A preorder, as you may know, is a sale of a game that occurs prior to its official release date. This metric is particularly useful for predicting a game's total sales volume throughout its lifecycle.

For this assessment, your task is to create a predictive forecast that estimates the total number of preorders for a forthcoming game named "Atlas Fallen" that is scheduled to be released later this year.
